Updated January 27th, 2015, up-to-date to version 1.8.5505.15894.

ModBot is designed to be a user-friendly bot for Twitch.TV, based heavily on LoyaltyBot.

This modification of ModBot directly uses the base code of the original ModBot available at http://twitchmodbot.sourceforge.net.
Even though most of the original code has been modified, this project would probably have never been started without it.

Any questions/comments/suggestions can be emailed to me @ CoMaNdO.ModBot@gmail.com

Requires .NET Framework 4. Most Windows users should have it already, but if not: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718



************************INSTALLATION************************

Head to http://ModBot.wordpress.com/installation



************************SUBSCRIBERS (Regulars)**************

ModBot features 2 ways to handle subscribers: a google docs spreadsheet, or adding someone as a sub via the database. They do not conflict with each other, so if you happen to have someones name in both they will not have the subscriber effect twice or more. Just pick whichever one is more convenient for you to use, or a combination. Really doesn't matter, although it is recommended to use the database method.

	Google Docs (Support not provided, if you encounter any issues you're on your own, use the database method instead):
		If you already use LoyaltyBot, you can use the exact same subscribers link.
		If you don't use LoyaltyBot and want to make a google docs spreadsheet to more easily manage your subscribers list:
			1) Create a new spreadsheet at http://docs.google.com/
			2) Set cell A1 as the header "Username"
			3) Subscriber Names will then be placed in Column A cells, starting with A2. (Fig. 1)
			4) Set the Subscriber list to Public, and change the type to json. (Fig. 2)
				*Note: Even if you don't have a Sub button, you can still add people to your sub list so that they receive double currency income.

	Database:
		Use the following command to add a subscriber:
		!modbot addsub <username>

		Use the following command to remove a subscriber:
		!modbot removesub <username>



************************USER ACCESS LEVELS******************

Something that you need to understand for this bot are the user levels. 
	You, the broadcaster, are always Level 5. You have access to every command.
	Normal users in the channel are level 0. They have access to all commands that are set to level 0.
	Level 1 users are Helpers. They have basic access.
	Level 2 users are Moderators. They have more advanced access.
	Level 3 users are Super mods. They have access to all commands except the ones that affect all users or the channel.
	Level 4 users are Trusted mods. They have access that is equal to the streamer, add only people you trust to this level.

Access of each level is described below.



************************COMMANDS****************************

Currency:
	!currency/!<currency> - (Anyone or Access Level 1 if the command is disabled) Checks your current amount of currency on the channel.

	!currency/!<currency> enable/disable - (Access Level 3) Enable or disable the currency command.
	!currency/!<currency> add <username/online/all> <amount> - (Access Level 3) Adds the specified amount of currency to the username. Using "online" as the username will give the specified of currency to all online users in the channel. Using "all" (Access Level 4) as the username will give the specified of currency to all users that have ever visited the channel.
	!currency/!<currency> set <username/online/all> <amount> - (Access Level 3) Sets the specified amount of currency to the username. Using "online" as the username will set the specified of currency to all online users in the channel.

	!time top5 - (Anyone) Provides a list of the 5 users with the most time watched (5 minutes cooldown, mods not affected).
	!time <username> - (Access Level 1) Manually check the time watched of a specific person.
	!time enable/disable - (Access Level 3) Enable or disable the time command.



Custom commands:
	!modbot addcmd <AccessLevelRequired> <command> <output> - (Access Level 2) Access level must be between 0 and 4. Command and output can be any text. Quick example: "!mod addcom 0 !ts Come hang out with on on teamspeak" would add a !ts command that anyone in the channel could use. If the first character of the <output> is a /, it will be stripped.
	!modbot delcmd <command> - (Access Level 2) Deletes the command. Currently if you want to edit a command, you must delete it and re-add it.
	!modbot cmdlist - (Access Level 1) Lists all of the custom commands currently available to the channel.

	* The commands will always trigger if they're the first word in the sentence, so you might want to have a "command identifier" such as ! to prevent "accidental triggers" from occuring.
	* You can also use {NUMBER} as parameters where NUMBER represents the parameter index that will be copied.
	  Example: !modbot addcmd 0 !welcome Welcome to the stream {1}!
		       !welcome DorCoMaNdO
	  Output:  Welcome to the stream DorCoMaNdO!
	* All of the parameters are required so a message will NOT be sent if you'd try to do something such as using just "!welcome" on the example above.

	!modbot addhelper <username> - (Access Level 3) Changes the person to a Helper (Access Level 1).
	!modbot addmod <username> - (Access Level 3) Changes the person to a Moderator (Access Level 2).
